            <h4>The Client</h4>
            <p>Lush invent, manufacture and sell fresh handmade cosmetics. Originating in Dorset, UK starting with just 1 shop 20 years ago – now with over 900 shops and websites in 51 countries with a global turnover in the region of £600m. Lush strive to source all of the highest quality ingredients in a ethical manner, and pride themselves on the freshness of the product from its source onto the customers skin. Lush take a strong stance on issues close to their heart such as ending cosmetic testing on animals and donate to grassroots charities though their Charity Pot scheme.</p>
            <h4>The Challenge</h4>
            <p>With Lush’s in-store sales far outweighing those online, Lush wanted to create a digital experience that wouldweave its stories throughout every page of its website and result in a spike in online sales. The brand turned to a partnership between FFW and Acquia (Acquia are a premium digital platform provider and specialists in Drupal hosting) to provide a seamless integration between content and commerce and deliver High Availability, Global Commerce Platform that can spin-up local country, online shops allowing each country to make adjustments and translations to its content but ensuring consistent data flow, business intelligence and reports throughout all instances.</p>

            <h4>The Solution</h4>
            <p>LUSH Global Architecture platform is Open Source driven and the biggest commerce platform built on top of Drupal Commerce. It took 8 months, 3700 Jira tasks and team reaching on specific moments 25 FFW people to complete the project. It was run following the Scrum Agile project management framework. The scrum teams were formed of people from each organisation and they strove to do the right thing for the client irrespective of organisational boundaries. Here are some technical facts about the project:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Every aspect of the technical development for the platform was automated: from Vagrant profiles enabling each completion to fully covered with behavioural automated tests code to ensure there are no regressions. FFW delivered extensive documentation and procedures to LUSH on how other vendors could work with their platform if required giving LUSH vendor independence</li>
              <li>The Global Platform was built with ability for regional scalability and adaptability to ensure specific local region needs</li>
              <li>Elements of the platform: Customer Services portal, Orders Store Backed acting as CAAS (Commerce as a Service), Content repository, Single Sign on portal, Stock Management Layer, High availability Queue system for synchronisation orders and data between systems, Lingotek and automated translations, Cloudflare Cache Layer, Warehouse integration, Plug-in enabled External Payment gateways, Mandrill integration for email delivery, Mobile API layer</li>
              <li>Numerous stress and load tests have been executed to ensure that the platform can handle peak trafficscenarios (normally around holidays like Black Friday)</li>
              <li>The Global Platform is based on a digital Cloud platform to ensure elastic distribution of hardware resources and ability to increase processing power within minutes upon request</li>
              <li>FFW delivered 24/7 first and second level of support over the first sales campaign. Video training materials also have been provided to the Lush Global editors. After the initial sales campaign, the 24/7 support started to be handled by the digital cloud platform team</li>
              <li>FFW built an Android App, first based on Lush’s already existing iOS app and later on advising and adding features specifically for Google Android platform and Material Design</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>The Results</h4>
            <p>After the launch, the Lush website realised dramatic spikes in both web traffic and online sales; Conversion and engagement metrics improved far beyond expectations, and the site was named an “inspiring mobile commerce website” by Econsultancy. Here’s more:</p>
